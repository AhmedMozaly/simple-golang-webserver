# simple-golang-webserver
An extremely simple and novice attempt at a golang blog-esc static web server and website, free to be re-used.

Feel free to fork and improve, this is a slow and arduious exploration of Golang for me and is going to be a tangled mess forever.

****The following practices within the GoLang language are used (to various degrees of success)

    - Multiple packages with exported types and methods
    - Custom Structs and Types
    - MultiThreading with Go routines
    - Database accessing (****MySQL)
    - HTML and text based templating for static data
