An extremely simple and novice attempt at a golang blog-esc static web server and website, free to be re-used.

Feel free to fork and improve, this is a slow and arduious exploration of Golang for me and is going to be a tangled mess forever.

**The following practices within the GoLang language are used (to various degrees of success)**

    - Multiple packages with exported types and methods
    - Custom Structs and Types
    - MultiThreading with Go routines
    - Database accessing (MySQL, MongoDB was/is a possible future feature)
    - HTML and text based templating for static data

# Planned

*Weither or not these following features get implimented is as of yet utterly unknown.

    - Replacement of HTML templates with Vue.js/React.js components.
    - Creation of a "REST" API service to be consumed by web components.
    - MongoDB or similar document storage solution.
    - Admin/Creator page for modifying/adding articles. 
    - Markdown editor / Article editor.
